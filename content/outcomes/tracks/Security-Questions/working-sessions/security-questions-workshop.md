## Synopsis and Takeaways

The sessions were popular and productive, and at the final tally, about 145 questions were developed by participants at the Summit.  However, we agreed at the end that to make such question-generating sessions more impactful in future, there needs to be more context for workshops such as these.

The competitive yet collegial quizzes each evening generated great buzz and additional questions.
