### Working Sessions
**Working Sessions** focus on creating and evolving ideas to create outcomes that will have an impact in the real world. They are a great way to join a group of practitioners to share expertise and knowledge on a particular subject.

### User Sessions
**User Sessions** are practical sessions which will enable you to learn new skills or develop existing ones. They are also an opportunity to test the outcomes of some of the Working Sessions. These are a presentation-free environment, driven by practitioners working with users.

<br/>
### Product Sessions
**Product Sessions** are based around commercial products or services (i.e. not freely available)

The product sessions are designed to provide an environment to share real-world insights about the products, to learn more about how to use them, and to engage directly with the vendor.

Vendors are key players in the security landscape and these sessions (all happening during the evening) allow customers and potential customers to interact directly with knowledgeable vendor  SMEs.

### Keynotes
**Keynote** establishes the framework for the programme of the summit. The keynotes speaker at the summit includes the central subjects in his speech and gives an overview of the spirit in which the summit will be realised.

### Why Create a Session?
We would like to hear from you about your `challenges`, `passions` and `interests`. You can define a session which would cover the topic and subjects that you are interested in.

Choose the appropriate session type (`working` or `user`), describe the session (write content), define the expected outcomes, and be an  evangelist for the session you created. In this way you will recruit other, like-minded participants.
