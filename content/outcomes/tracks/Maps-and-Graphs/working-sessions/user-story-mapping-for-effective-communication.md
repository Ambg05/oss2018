## Outcomes/Deliverables 
- A number of visualisations of user mappings

## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)
- Methodology of user mapping was discussed:
   - Write a high-level story or epic
   - Break it down into a series of smaller stories
   - The stories should be written from the user's perspective:
      - Describe the type of user, what they want, and why 
      
 ### 'Invest' mnemonic
 - **I**ndependent
 - **N**egotiable
 - **V**aluable
 - **E**stimable
 - **S**mall
 - **T**estable
 
 ### Session examples
First example:
    - A Chief Compliance Officer (the user)
    - I want to be PCI compliant (what they want)
    - So I can process credit card payments (why)

The various elements of this epic can be analysed as smaller stories or tasks within the epic, that can be done by the devs, for example:
- Encryption 
- OWASP Top 10
- Card holder data
- Intrusion detection

Or, reverse engineer what makes sense to the devs
