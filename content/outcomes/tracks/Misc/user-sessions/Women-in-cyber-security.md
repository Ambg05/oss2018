## Outcomes/Deliverables (recommend)

- List of practical, valuable actions that help ourselves as well as others
- Agreement to check back with the group in three or six months, rather than waiting until next year

## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)
The following list of action was agreed:
- The next summit should have a number of sessions which every participant should attend
   - e.g. Ethics in Security, Women in CyberSec
- Reach out to schools:
   - Schoolchildren came to AppSec Belfast & AppSec Israel
   - The next summit could invite schools to participate?
   - School programmes need to be longer term, one day or one visit isn't sufficient to engage long term interest
- Share opportunities:
   - If you are asked to speak at an even but cannot attend, nominate a woman to take your place
   - Personally invite women to events you participate in 
      - The Ottawa OWASP chapter increased its attendance rate from 100 to 800 using this method
- Be inclusive, not exclusive
   - This is not just about including more women, but about increasing general diversity
- Become a Mentor/mentee
   - Sponsorship works like an advocacy programme
   - Consider creating a personal go-to board of directors
- Humility v. Insecurity
   - Understand that humility is not the same as insecurity.  The ability to admit not knowing or understanding something is a strength
   - Remember that other people at your meeting/conference will also feel doubt, not just you
- Watch the Imposter Syndrome Ted Talk (see References)
- Watch the Body Language Ted Talk (See References)
